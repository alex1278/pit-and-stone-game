# Bol Game UI

This project was bootstrapped with the create react app generator.
It is definitely still a work in progress and is not entirely functional. 

## Architecture Goals

The project aimed to leverage redux to reflect state as derived from the server - reducing all business logic to the game engine.

## StartUp

Navigate to the root of the directory, run npm install to resolve all dependencies,
and npm start to spin up a web server listening on on port 3000;
